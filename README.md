### Task List

- [x] [Watch the demo](https://youtu.be/qTc45Lox97g).

- [x] You're going to make a game just like the one in the video. Essentially, the app randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app chose. Put the following text on your page:

- [x] Guess what letter I'm thinking of

- [x] Make sure that keys other than letters do not count towards the game

- [x] Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)

- [ ] Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)

- [x] Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update)

- [x] Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. Display these until the user either wins or loses.)

- [ ] When the player wins, increase the Wins counter and start the game over again (without refreshing the page).

- [ ] When the player loses, increase the Losses counter and restart the game without a page refresh (just like when the user wins).

- [x] Make sure your game looks like this: ![Psychic](Images/1-Psychic.jpg)
